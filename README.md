# Node.JS + TypeScript Test

People coming from a C/C++/C#/Java background appreciate the similarities of ECMAScript / JavaScript
but wish they had typing, type checking, code completion, and an IDE that supports these.

People coming from a Lisp/Scala/Python/Ruby background appreciate the similarities of CoffeeScript,
and don't necessarily wish they had any of the above and tend to use a text editor like VIM rather than
an IDE, but still they acknowledge sometimes type errors do happen in dynamically typed languages,
and it might be nice if the compiler alerted you to this before runtime.

Regardless both can come together around the speed of Node.JS event loop, its Continuation-passing style,
and the async i/o power of libuv and modern operating systems and multi-core hardware.

## Testing / Watching
```bash
npm test
```

## Compiling
```bash
npm run-script prestart
```

## Running
